If this design uses ARM processors and runs software applications, these applications should be ./src/zynq.
Create a subdir for each application. The name of the dir will be used to name the application.

The elf file (for the BRAMs in the PL part) to be merged with the bitstream is located in ./src/processor-based.

Dont place any other dir or file in these folders.
